Small project for Bird recognition with tensorflow , the data is only 4 kinds of birds
using teachable machine i was able to create a small program to distinguishe between 4 different kind of birds

Thanks to Amnah,

The code is mostly from teachable machine site with more adjustments to make it print out what is most likely the bird in whatever picture it's given , if it can't recognize -or all the precentages less than 50%- it will print : i can not recognize this bird.

I hope the code is clear.
Also you can ask me in my twitter profile if anything is unclear
